Advent of Code 2022

Run `./getinput.sh [DAY]` to download the input for a particular day. The script depends on `curl`; if you are on a Debian-based distro, you will have the option for it to be installed automatically. The script assumes you have extracted your user login `session` cookie from the AoC website into `cookie.txt` with the format `session=[cookie hash]`. Remember to make the script executable with `chmod +x ./getinput.sh`.

A `requirements.txt` has been provided for dependencies found across the solutions.
